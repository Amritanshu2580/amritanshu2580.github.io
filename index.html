      <h1>Happy Birthday, Angel(Divu)! ❤️</h1>
      <p>
        Angel naam maine hi rakha tha but with time I kind of <br>
        started calling you Divu. See, I know ki aaj tu busy rahegi <br>
        toh I plan on giving you this website some other day, maybe 23 <br>
        or 24 as per convenience. See, I thought of giving you gifts <br>
        but tu kuch accept karegi nhi, and then I thought of <br>
        making this website. Abhi toh mai bss iss cheez ko <br>
        kuch hi mahine sikha hu, and due to time constraints and <br>
        lack of skills, uttna accha na bana pau abhi but <br>
        like I'll try my best. Haa! Toh main baat koi <br>
        jada gift meko smjh aa nhi rha tha ki kya du toh <br>
        I just thought ki ek image gallery type ka kuch bana du. <br>
        At this point, even I don't know how it'll turn out but <br>
        let's see!!
